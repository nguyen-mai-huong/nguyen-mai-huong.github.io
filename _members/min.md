I'm an associate professor with research interests that span digital libraries, natural language processing and information retrieval. Specific interests include: scholarly digital libraries, definitional QA, statistical MT, text summarization, verb analysis, optimizing access to scientific literature, web crawling, and combining search and browsing user interfaces under human-computer interaction. I'm a senior member of the ACM and the IEEE, and a member of the ACL, NUS' NGS, and PREMIA. I graduated with my Ph.D. from Columbia University. Here's a link to my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/knmnyn) and my [perennially outdated 1-page C.V](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/cv.1page.pdf). Please feel free to contact me about any synergies between your research interests and mine. Thank you!

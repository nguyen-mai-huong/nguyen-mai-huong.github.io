I am a third year PhD student at the National University of Singapore under A-STAR SINGA programme. I am co-advised by Nancy Chen from A-STAR / I2R and Min Yen Kan from NUS / SoC. I am interested in working with text data, especially the conversational ones. Specifically, I am working on domain-adaptation for task-oriented dialogues in the low data scheme (few/zero-shot). Previously I got my bachelorâ€™s in Bilkent University in Computer Science and also worked part-time for a year in Milsoft as a software engineer.

Apart from my academic studies, I like to read Japanese literature and sci-fi / fantasy novels. I also like to play board games (Battle Line, Catan, The Resistance and Puerto Rico are among my favorites).
